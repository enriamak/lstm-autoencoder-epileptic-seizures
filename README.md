# Anomaly Detection of Epileptic Seizures with Autoencoders

# Description
In this work, it is proposed to carry out machine learning for the detection of anomalies in cases
of epilepsy through the analysis of EEG signals. A study of the impact/benefit of incorporating
temporality into LSTM neural network models, mainly Autoencoders, capable of classifying anomalies,
will be carried out.

Its prevention would improve the quality of life of patients by reducing the number and severity of
injuries caused by epilepsy, in order to take sufficient preventive measures.

Different models have been previously applied (Random Forest, SVM, KNN,...) that allow
classifications to be made with precision between 80% and 98%. The results of using Autoencoders
show an 85.6% accuracy in the classification of anomalies in EEG signals.
